# Loan_Default_Prediction

Predicting the likelihood of a client defaulting on a loan is a challenging problem faced by banks, especially when they only have a limited amount of information. To tackle this problem, data science teams at banks often use machine learning to build predictive models. These models are typically trained using proprietary datasets that are collected internally through the bank's daily business operations. As a result, it can be difficult to find real-world datasets to use for financial projects like this.
